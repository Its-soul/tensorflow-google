# tensorflow-google

A collection of TensorFlow learning modules—structured as units of exercises inspired by Google’s TensorFlow concepts.

## Repository Structure

- `unit-1/`: Introduction to TensorFlow—basic data manipulation, model creation, and training examples.  
- `unit-2/`: Intermediate TensorFlow workflows—model tuning, evaluation, and deployment experiments.  
- `resources/`: Supplementary assets (datasets, reference guides, etc.).  
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies.  
- `.gitignore`: Standard Python ignores.
